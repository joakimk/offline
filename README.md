An experiment with TypeScript and possibly a game later on.

If you use VSCode it will autosave on changes.

Setup:

    yarn install

Run this to auto build `src/*.ts` into `release/offline.html`:

    make live

This also starts a web server at http://localhost:4444 and live updating via web socket.
